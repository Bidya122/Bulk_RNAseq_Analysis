This repository contains scripts, workflows, and documentation for performing bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis.

**ONECUT2 and Hypoxia Signaling in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer**  
Experimental Design:  
This repository contains datasets and analysis scripts for studying the role of ONECUT2 (OC2) in hypoxia signaling in prostate cancer. The experiments were performed using LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines under normoxia and hypoxia conditions.

**RNA-Seq**  
LNCaP cells: OC2 overexpression vs. control
PC3 cells: OC2 knockdown vs. control
Goal: Identify OC2-regulated gene expression changes under different oxygen conditions.

**ChIP-Seq**  
PC3 cells with Flag-OC2 fusion protein: anti-Flag ChIP to map OC2 binding sites
HIF1A ChIP-Seq: AR-negative PC3 cells under hypoxia ± ONECUT2 or SMAD3 knockdown
SMAD3 and HIF2A ChIP-Seq: PC3 cells under hypoxia
Goal: Map transcription factor binding sites and identify OC2 targets in hypoxia response.

**ChIP-reChIP-Seq**  
Sequential ChIP experiments to study co-binding of transcription factors:
Primary ChIP using anti-SMAD3 antibody
ReChIP using anti-HIF1A or anti-HIF2A antibodies
Goal: Identify genomic regions co-bound by multiple transcription factors.

**Lets Start with the Workflow, Since my laptop has very low RAM and cannot support the analysis, I chose to perform the work on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This not only solves the hardware limitation but also provides me with valuable experience in cloud computing.**
