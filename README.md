# ONECUT2 and Hypoxia Signaling in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer
Experimental Design

This repository contains datasets and analysis scripts for studying the role of ONECUT2 (OC2) in hypoxia signaling in prostate cancer. The experiments were performed using LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines under normoxia and hypoxia conditions.
RNA-Seq

LNCaP cells: OC2 overexpression vs. control

PC3 cells: OC2 knockdown vs. control

Goal: Identify OC2-regulated gene expression changes under different oxygen conditions.

ChIP-Seq

PC3 cells with Flag-OC2 fusion protein: anti-Flag ChIP to map OC2 binding sites

HIF1A ChIP-Seq: AR-negative PC3 cells under hypoxia Â± ONECUT2 or SMAD3 knockdown

SMAD3 and HIF2A ChIP-Seq: PC3 cells under hypoxia

Goal: Map transcription factor binding sites and identify OC2 targets in hypoxia response.

ChIP-reChIP-Seq

Sequential ChIP experiments to study co-binding of transcription factors:

Primary ChIP using anti-SMAD3 antibody

ReChIP using anti-HIF1A or anti-HIF2A antibodies

The reChIPed DNA was sequenced to identify genomic regions co-bound by multiple transcription factors.

Purpose

Understand the transcriptional network driven by ONECUT2 in neuroendocrine prostate cancer

Integrate RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data to elucidate hypoxia-mediated gene regulation

Explore transcription factor interactions under hypoxia conditions
